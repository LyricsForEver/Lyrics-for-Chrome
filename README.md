Lyrics for Google Chrome™
=========================

The extension
-------------
This plugin brings lyrics to video's on YouTube™ and songs on Last.fm™, without annoying popups! The lyrics will blend flawlessly with the page, as if the lyrics section was designed by YouTube™ or Last.fm™ themselves.

How it works
------------

- A small icon will show up on music pages, next to the URL bar
- Clicking this icon will add another section to the page
- Automatically, the lyrics are fetched from A - Z Lyrics™
- If no lyrics were found, a form on the page shows up, which enables you to do a manual search


Original idea
-------------

The original idea for this extension came from [Oren Yomtov's extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kggldhblikkmmnbkeococbeoaacgelkf "Google Webstore - Original plugin") which adds lyrics to YouTube™ videos. He did a great job, and my first intention was to extend that plugin. However, with some extra features I decided to create a separate extension of it.
