This plugin brings lyrics to video's and songs on YouTube™, Last.fm™, Grooveshark™ and Google Music™, without annoying popups! You can either chose to blend the lyrics flawlessly with the page, or show them in a beautifully designed tab.

- Clicking this icon adds another section to the page
- Automatically, the lyrics are fetched from LyricsWiki™

- You can also start searching for lyrics, by typing "lyrics ..." in the omnibox
- Not only is it possible to search for a song title, you can also search for words you remember of the lyrics


Plans for the next release
